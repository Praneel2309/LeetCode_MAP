# About Me

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Praneel Sharma, a passionate software engineer focused on improving my problem-solving skills. I love working with data structures and algorithms, and I have spent some time solving problems on the platform [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/),
about some basic Map problems in C++ Data Structures. 

In this repository, I've solved several basic map-based problems to strengthen my understanding of **unordered maps** and **key-value pair manipulation**. Below are 5 such problems that I've worked on:

## LeetCode Map-Based Problems

### 1. **Two Sum**
- **Problem Link**: [Two Sum - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum)
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Description**: Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to a specific target. This problem is solved efficiently using an `unordered_map` to check for the complement of each number.

### 2. **Longest Consecutive Sequence**
- **Problem Link**: [Longest Consecutive Sequence - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence)
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Description**: Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. A hash set or map can be used to track the sequences and their lengths for efficient solution.

### 3. **First Unique Character in a String**
- **Problem Link**: [First Unique Character in a String - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string)
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Description**: Given a string, find the first non-repeating character and return its index. This problem can be solved using a hash map to count the frequency of characters and then finding the first character with a count of 1.

### 4. **Top K Frequent Elements**
- **Problem Link**: [Top K Frequent Elements - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements)
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Description**: Given an integer array, return the k most frequent elements. This problem can be solved using a frequency map (unordered_map) and a heap to find the top k frequent elements.

### 5. **Valid Sudoku**
- **Problem Link**: [Valid Sudoku - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku)
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Description**: Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. The board is valid if each row, each column, and each of the 9 subgrids contain no duplicate digits. This problem can be solved by using hash maps to track the digits in rows, columns, and subgrids.
